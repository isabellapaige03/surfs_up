# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the weather for Oahu, Hawaii is suitable for a surf and ice cream shop. We'll determine if the weather is suitable by looking at the summary statistics for the month of June and the month of December. The summary statistics will provide us with the average temperatures, maximum temperatures and the minimum temperatures for each month.

## Results

# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the weather for Oahu, Hawaii is suitable for a surf and ice cream shop. We'll determine if the weather is suitable by looking at the summary statistics for the month of June and the month of December. The summary statistics will provide us with the average temperatures, maximum temperatures and the minimum temperatures for each month.

## Results
Below are the summary statistics for the temperatures in June.

In the first table we can see the average temperature in June is 75 degrees. The low for the month was 64 degrees and the high was 85 degrees. The June weather in Oahu is suitable for the surf and ice cream shop. The weather for December was similar to June with an average temperature of 71 degrees and a high of 83 degrees. However, the low for the month of December was almost 10 degrees cooler than for June. The minimum temperature in December was 56 degrees. 

## Summary
  Oahu, Hawaii seems like a suitable location for a surf and ice cream shop due to its warm temperatures year-round. The low temperature for December isnâ€™t too concerning because the average temperature is much warmer.  There are more factors we could consider before making a final decision. We can add an additional query to look at the statistics for rainfall throughout the year. Rainy weather would not be suitable for the surf and ice cream shop. In addition, we could look at wind patterns to determine if the waves would be suitable for surfers.
